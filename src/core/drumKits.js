 * that put the snare there. The corpus was played on a Roland TD-11, General
 * MIDI put the same drums in different places, and every sampler since has had
 * its own opinion. A groove sent to the wrong map does not sound transposed, it
 * sounds like somebody hitting the wrong drums, which is worse because it reads
 * as a broken feature rather than a wrong setting.
 *
 * So nothing is mapped pitch-to-pitch. Everything goes through a vocabulary of
 * fourteen voices: the corpus is read *into* it, and a kit map writes it back
 * out. Two small tables instead of one large one per pair, and the half that
 * comes from the corpus is published by the people who recorded it.

   * A verdict a kit cannot actually play is not a verdict -- but neither is no

   *
   * Two faults, one after the other. First, every pack was called General MIDI
   * whatever was in it: measured across the collection, `Africa`, `Asia` and
   * `Europe` put **100% of their notes outside anything General MIDI can
   * read** -- hand-percussion packs living between 60 and 81, where a
   * vocabulary of fourteen kit voices has no room at all -- and each was
   * named, filed and silent on playback.
   *
   * The fix for that was to refuse: below a threshold, name nothing and let the
   * library follow whatever the Kit tab said. Which is worse, because it is not
   * an answer. Which numbering a library's files are written in is a **fact
   * about those files**; it does not change when somebody picks a different
   * drum instrument for the track, and a library whose map follows a global
   * setting is one whose notes move under it for reasons that have nothing to
   * do with the library.
   *
   * So there is always a kit. When the obvious one cannot read the notes, every
   * kit is tried and the one that reads the most wins -- and when they are all
   * poor, the best of a bad set is still named and `coverage` says plainly how
   * bad. A wrong answer you can see and change beats a deferral you cannot.
