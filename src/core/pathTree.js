/**
 * A catalogue as the tree it already is.
 *
 * The first attempt drew words joined by how often they turn up together, and
 * it was a hairball: every word related to every other, a hundred thousand
 * hairlines, and no way to tell where you were. The mistake was treating a
 * collection of files as a network. It is not a network. It is a tree, and it
 * has been one all along -- libraries, then folders, then folders, then clips.
 *
 * So each node is a *place in the tree*, identified by the whole path down to
 * it. Two folders both called `Rock` in two different libraries are two nodes,
 * because they are two folders; joining them would be asserting a relationship
 * that does not exist and is the sort of thing that makes a hairball.
 *
 * Every node has exactly one parent, so the edge count is the node count. A
 * tree of a million nodes has a million edges where a co-occurrence graph of a
 * thousand had twenty thousand -- and it lays out as something with a shape
 * rather than as a cloud.
 *
 * **Sorting by a facet re-roots it.** With `sortBy: 'genre'` the top level
 * becomes the genres and every library hangs underneath the genre it is in, so
 * the same clips make a different tree. The path is simply prefixed, and
 * everything below works the same way.
