/**
 * A list of any length, drawn on a canvas.

 * The catalogue lists used to page: ten rows and a pager, because ten
 * thousand `<v-list-item>`s is a scroll of jank and three quarters of a
 * million is a dead tab. Paging is what a list does when it cannot hold what
 * it is showing. This can: canvas-datagrid draws the rows that are on screen
 * and no others, so the array behind it can be as long as the catalogue is
 * and scrolling costs the same at row 700,000 as at row 7.
 *
 * What it gives back that paging took away is the thing a musician actually
 * does with a catalogue -- run down it. There is no page thirty-four to find
 * your way to; the wheel goes where you were going.
 *
 * Styling is not CSS. The grid paints into a canvas, so every colour has to
 * be handed over as a value -- which means the theme has to be read rather
 * than inherited, and re-read when it changes. @see core/themes.js
