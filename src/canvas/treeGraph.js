/**
 * A catalogue's tree, explored by opening it.
 *
 * Two measurements decide everything in this file.
 *
 * The first: a real catalogue is 932,299 nodes and the screen holds about
 * fifty. The previous version handed the whole tree to the layout and built a
 * d3 hierarchy over all of it -- three full passes with an object allocated
 * per node -- in order to draw nineteen dots. That was 3.9 seconds to open a
 * window inside a DAW, which is several seconds longer than anybody waits for
 * a plugin before deciding it is broken. So nothing is materialised until it
 * is shown: the arrays are held exactly as the database gave them, and a node
 * becomes an object at the moment somebody opens its parent.
 * @see scripts/graph_perf.py, where those numbers come from.
 *
 * The second: opening a node must not rearrange the picture. A tidy tree
 * cannot do that -- keeping the tree tidy is exactly what makes every sibling
 * move when one node gains children, which is right for a tidy tree and wrong
 * for exploring one. So the layout is a force simulation. Children are born
 * at the point their parent occupies and bloom out of it, whatever is in the
 * way is nudged rather than re-placed, and the camera is not touched at all:
 * where you were looking is where you stay.
 *
 * Canvas rather than SVG, because a wide level of a real catalogue is a few
 * thousand nodes and that many DOM elements is a scroll of jank.
